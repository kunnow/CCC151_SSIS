SSIS - Simple Student Information System

There's been a big mistake in uploading my output in the repository and the clone git repository itself. We thought that you just had to upload your file to the repository, so we uploaded it. But since we aren't aware that you have to clone the git repository in VSCode, there's no history of commits whenever we do some minor editing in our codes. We are using a QtCreator so it's quite confusing for us on how to upload it or clone it in the repository before we initially just drag and drop our files. We aren't aware that you can convert your code for you to potentially edit it on VSCode and the visibility of the commits would be implemented.

So, I just decided that I will compare the last folder that I uploaded here at the repository and the folder "Final/SSIS" and make a docs file of it that contains all of my changes in my lines of code. Also, I didnâ€™t delete the two folder files that I first uploaded, for you to be aware that I initially uploaded my output before the deadline.

folder "SSIS" is the first output that I uploaded
folder "SSIS_2" is the second output that I uploaded
- first commit in the UI itself (you can see it in the docs file that I uploaded "Commits - SSIS"
  
folder "Final/SSIS" is my final output
- folder "01_Activity" is where the Qt Project file is located
- folder "keilah" is the file path of the resources

That's all. I hope you will take all the relevant factors regarding my situation into consideration.
