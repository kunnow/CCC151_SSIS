folder "01_Activity" is where the Qt Project file is located

folder "keilah" is the file path of the resources

Ps. I just noticed this earlier. I accidentally copied and pasted my two QLineEdits in "Add a Course" and forgot to remove them. So basically, there's a QLineEdit behind a QLineEdit. The reason why, my two QLineEdits are always empty even though I typed some data on it. But do not fret, if I'm going to delete my two QLineEdits (which is an easy process), my "Add a Course" will be functional again, as easily as that.
